Project Requirement Document
Project Name: Treads
Overview:
Treads is a social media application where users can post textual content, each piece of content being a thread. 
Users can comment on these threads, with the feature of nested commenting. 
Each comment itself will also be a thread. 
Users will be able to log in with either username/password or Google sign-in, handled by Firebase.

Detailed Requirements:
1. User Authentication:
Users should be able to register and log in to the application using a username/password combination or Google sign-in.
Firebase will be used for handling user authentication.
User data should be stored securely in MongoDB.
2. Thread Posting:
Authenticated users should be able to post textual content, each piece of content being a thread.
Each thread should be visible to all users of the application.
When a user posts a thread, a notification should be sent to all users who follow the poster.
3. Commenting:
Users should be able to comment on threads.
The commenting system should support nested comments, i.e., users should be able to comment on comments.
Each comment itself will be a thread.
4. Notifications:
Notifications should be sent to users when a user they follow posts a new thread.
Notifications should also be sent for comments on the user's threads.
The notification should link to the relevant thread.
The notification system should be implemented using webhooks for real-time updates.
5. User Profiles:
Users should be able to view other users' profiles.
Users should be able to follow other users. Once followed, they will be subscribed to the activity notifications for the user.
6. Data Storage:
All data should be stored in MongoDB.
Data integrity should be ensured with data validation using Zod.
7. User Interface:
The application should have a user-friendly interface for posting threads, commenting, and viewing notifications.
React Hook Form should be used for efficient management of forms and user input.
8. Security:
Middleware, API actions, and authorization should be used for robust application security.
Technical Stack:
Frontend: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: Firebase
Real-time updates: Webhooks
Data Validation: Zod
Form Management: React Hook Form
Milestones:
Setup project with Next.js and TypeScript.
Integrate Firebase for user authentication.
Setup MongoDB for data storage.
Implement thread posting functionality.
Implement commenting functionality with nested comments.
Implement user profiles and following functionality.
Implement notification system with webhooks.
Implement data validation with Zod.
Implement form management with React Hook Form.
Implement security measures with middleware, API actions, and authorization.
Testing and deployment.
Risks and Mitigation:
Risk: Data breaches due to inadequate security measures.
Mitigation: Implement robust security measures using middleware, API actions, and authorization.
Risk: Poor user experience due to complex interface.
Mitigation: Use React Hook Form for efficient form management and ensure the interface is user-friendly.
Risk: Data inconsistency due to lack of data validation.
Mitigation: Implement data validation using Zod to ensure data integrity.
Conclusion:
The Treads application will provide a platform for users to post threads, comment on threads, and follow other users.
The application will use Firebase for authentication, MongoDB for data storage, and webhooks for real-time updates. 
The application will ensure data integrity and a streamlined user input experience.




Authentication and Authorization TODO

Install necessary packages: Firebase SDK, Firebase types for TypeScript, MongoDB driver for Node.js.
Create a Firebase project and enable Email/Password and Google authentication methods.
Connect your Next.js application to MongoDB.
Create a firebaseClient.ts file to initialize Firebase with your Firebase project's configuration.
Export functions for signing in with email/password and Google.
Create a registration form component using React Hook Form.
On form submission, call the Firebase sign-in function with the entered email and password.
Handle the promise returned by the Firebase function. On success, redirect the user to the onboarding page. On failure, show an error message.
Create an onboarding form component. This form should collect any additional information you want to store for each user.
On form submission, save the entered data to the MongoDB user collection.
Create a login form component.
On form submission, call the Firebase sign-in function with the entered email and password.
Handle the promise returned by the Firebase function. On success, redirect the user to the main page of the app. On failure, show an error message.
Create a context for user authentication state (authContext.tsx).
Use the AuthProvider in your _app.tsx.
Use the AuthContext in your components to access the current user and loading state.
Create a logout function in firebaseClient.ts that calls Firebase's sign-out function.
Use this function in your components to log out the user.
Implement error handling for all Firebase and MongoDB operations. Show user-friendly error messages.
Test all authentication flows: registration, login, logout, and onboarding.
Test error handling by triggering errors (e.g., enter an incorrect password during login).
Deploy the application and test the authentication flows in the production environment.
